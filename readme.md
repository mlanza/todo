# Atomic â€¢ [TodoMVC](http://todomvc.com)

> Write Clojuresque functional core, imperative shell programs in JavaScript.

## Resources

- [Website](https://github.com/mlanza/atomic)

## Implementation

Atomic apps build on [this advice](https://github.com/mlanza/atomic#guidance-for-writing-apps).  This is demonstrated in the separation of

* its [functional core](./js/todos.js) and
* its [imperative shell](./js/app.js).

## Getting Started

From the command line project root:

```bash
npm install
static # e.g. bring up the static server of your choice
```

Then open your browser to the server address shown in the shell to see the app.

## Browser as REPL

Open the browser console in Developer Tools.  Note what's being written to the log as you interact with the app.

Temporarily and deliberately expose whichever vars you choose as globals.  Do this to facilitate interactive, REPL-driven development.

Enter `$state` into the console, for example, to access the world state.  Swap functions against it at will.

Enter `cmd()` to expose all the modules as `_`, `$`, `dom`, `t`, etc. in the global namespace as needed to further aid your interactivity.
