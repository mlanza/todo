## Implementation

To model an atomic app follow [this advice](https://github.com/mlanza/atomic#guidance-for-writing-apps).  This todo app can be served

## Getting Started

From the command line:

```bash
npm install
static
```

Bring up the browser console and mind the log.  If desired, type `cmd()` to gain direct access to the Atomic modules.  If portions of an app are deliberately exposed, one can interact with it, live.
